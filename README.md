## What's in it?

Currently, nothing, but we plan to add everything from PridePack, as their own things to go *with* the vanilla game
instead of replacing them, along wtih a few exclusive features.

## How do I get it?

You either compile it from source, like you would compile any other Fabric/Quilt mod, or you check on the releases tab
for pre-releases.

## When are you making this?

Sometime between ``December 31, 1969 9:00 PM`` and ``November 16, 5138 6:46 AM``
